            <p>Acquiring the permeability and distribution of underground permeable structures (such as hydraulic fractures) is of great significance in oil & gas exploration and development. In this study, a borehole model of stratified porous formation was constructed based on Biot theory, studying the reflection and transmission of Stoneley wave across permeable formation using the finite difference method and effective wave number analytical method. The reflection and transmission coefficients calculated by two methods of Stoneley wave, which travels across single and multiple permeable layers with different thickness, porosity and permeability, are analyzed. The results not only reveal the variation of the reflection and transmission coefficients of Stoneley wave under different formation conditions, but the comparison of two methods’ results verifies the validity of the analytical method in the low frequency range(0-2kHz). Finally, using the finite different method to investigate the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients of Stoneley wave across fractures formation with different permeability, thickness and radial extension length. The results of this study aim at providing theoretical basis for the practical application and analysis of Stoneley wave data. A paper of this study has been received by Chinese Journal of Geophysics(SCI).</p>

            <p>Underground rocks always contain both pores and cracks, thus two attenuation mechanisms, which are macroscopic flow and local flow, can happen in complex subsurface and cause great attenuation to elastic wave propagation. Therefore, simulating the elastic wave propagation in underground porous and poro-crack media is an important research topic. In this study, a finite difference algorithm is developed to simulate the multi-physical structures including poro-crack media, which can be applied into rock physics and acoustic logging wave field simulation. Firstly, the time domain form of the equations of poro-crack media is derived by introducing auxiliary partial differential equations to eliminate the influence of time domain convolution. Then, the finite difference method is applied to discretely solve the time-domain equations, simulating the wave dispersion and attenuation of the poro-crack media and the synthetic acoustic pressure array waveform of the borehole model with the poro-crack formation. The calculation results are validated by the analytical solution. Finally, by averaging the boundary of the model, the finite difference method can simulate the wave field of coupled model containing elastic fluid, solid, porous and poro-crack media. Consequently, in this study, the time-domain form of poro-crack equations are firstly derived theoretically, and the correctness of the newly proposed finite difference algorithm is verified, which looks for further application. This work is being written and to be published.</p>
