            <p>To prepare for the practical application and analysis of Stoneley wave data. A borehole model of stratified porous formation was constructed based on Biot theory. The reflection and transmission of Stoneley wave across permeable and fractured formation are studied using the finite difference method and effective wave number analytical method, which leads to the recent publication on <i>Chinese Journal of Geophysics(In press)</i>.</p>

            </div>
            <p>To honor the attenuation effects of the elastic wave propagations due to the existed pores and cracks of the subsurface, a finite difference method is developed to simulate propagation of the elastic wavefield in the multi-physical structures including elastic, poro-elastic and poro-crack media based on a squirt-flow model (Tang <i>et al</i>, 2011 and 2012). Calculation results of the FD method are validated against the analytical solutions. This novel time-domain finite difference method solving the poro-crack elastic wave equations has been largely finished and are under preparation.</p>
